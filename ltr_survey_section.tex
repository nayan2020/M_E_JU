Over the past decade, the field of pattern recognition and intelligent information extraction systems has experienced substantial advancements, particularly through the integration of traditional symbolic methodologies with contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) paradigms. Regular Expressions (RegEx), long-standing tools for syntactic string pattern matching, continue to be instrumental in various text processing applications. However, their deterministic nature and structural rigidity present significant challenges, especially when applied to noisy, semi-structured, or context-sensitive data, such as that encountered in natural language processing (NLP). These limitations have spurred interest in alternative approaches that incorporate semantic understanding, adaptive reasoning, and contextual awareness.

\vspace{0.5cm}

The advent of large language models (LLMs) has profoundly transformed the landscape of computational linguistics. Seminal studies, including those by Locascio et al.~\cite{locascio2016neural} and Li et al.~\cite{li2020transregex}, have demonstrated the potential of neural architectures to derive RegEx-like patterns from natural language inputs or example data. These pioneering efforts have laid the groundwork for hybrid systems that integrate symbolic reasoning with neural computation. Within this evolving context, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), introduced by Lewis et al.~\cite{lewis2020retrieval}, represents a significant paradigm shift. By combining a neural text generator with an external retrieval mechanism, RAG facilitates the production of factually accurate responses and supports reasoning capabilities grounded in dynamic, real-world information sources.

\vspace{0.5cm}

Recent work by Ferrag et al.~\cite{ferrag2025can} critically examines the capabilities of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in enabling multi-hop reasoning and orchestrating complex workflows. Their study highlights the consistent superiority of retrieval-augmented large language models over closed-book counterparts, including advanced models such as GPT-4. Using a combination of empirical benchmarks and taxonomy-driven evaluations, the authors demonstrate that integrating RAG with iterative reasoning loops significantly enhances both the accuracy and interpretability of responses across a wide range of tasks.

\vspace{0.5cm}

Notably, this body of research extends into the domain of agent-based architectures—commonly referred to as Agentic AI—which autonomously manage complex reasoning processes, tool selection, and task orchestration. These systems are characterized by goal-directed behavior, self-reflection, and iterative error correction, often coordinating actions across multiple external tools and heterogeneous knowledge sources. Prominent agentic frameworks such as AutoGPT, Reflexion, and ReAct exemplify this paradigm, achieving varying degrees of autonomy through modular planning components, persistent memory, and dynamic behavioral adaptation~\cite{autogpt2023,reflexion2023,react2022}.

\vspace{0.5cm}

Ferrag et al.~\cite{ferrag2025can} further propose a comprehensive taxonomy encompassing over 60 benchmarks introduced between 2019 and 2025, aimed at systematically evaluating the performance of large language model (LLM)-based agents across a diverse set of domains. These domains include mathematical reasoning, scientific literature review, code synthesis, factual retrieval, and embodied multimodal interaction. Their work highlights the emergence of specialized frameworks—such as \textit{LitSearch}, \textit{AgentTuning}, and \textit{ResearchArena}—that integrate LLMs with domain-specific toolkits tailored for academic, biomedical, and scientific research workflows.

\vspace{0.5cm}

Moreover, the study explores the role of multi-agent environments, wherein ensembles of domain-specialized agents collaborate to address complex, interdependent tasks. These architectures are inspired by the dynamics of human teams, incorporating mechanisms such as distributed memory, joint planning, and consensus-driven dialogue protocols. Such systems have been applied across a variety of domains, including multi-robot coordination, collaborative software engineering, policy simulation, and large-scale societal modeling~\cite{multiagent2024,autoteams2023,collective2025}.

\vspace{0.5cm}


Despite these notable advancements, several challenges persist. Key limitations include the reproducibility of agentic behavior, latency arising from complex tool orchestration, and the lack of universally standardized evaluation protocols, all of which constrain the scalable deployment of agent-based systems. Ferrag et al.~\cite{ferrag2025can} emphasize the need for modular, task-agnostic benchmarks capable of evaluating real-time reasoning capabilities, coordination of multi-tool workflows, and memory-informed planning strategies. Furthermore, the study draws attention to pressing ethical considerations—particularly those related to interpretability, fairness, and transparency—which necessitate the establishment of robust governance frameworks and alignment with evolving regulatory standards.

\vspace{0.5cm}

In conclusion, the existing body of literature offers compelling empirical and theoretical support for progressing beyond static Regular Expression (RegEx) systems. This thesis builds upon these insights by introducing a novel, context-aware framework for pattern extraction that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Agentic AI. The proposed approach aligns with the broader trajectory of intelligent, adaptive systems in computational linguistics and information engineering.

\vspace{0.5cm}

The intersection of traditional pattern recognition techniques—such as RegEx—and advanced AI architectures represents a pivotal shift in the field of information extraction. Although RegEx has played a foundational role, it remains constrained by its syntactic rigidity and lack of semantic comprehension. A growing body of research has highlighted its limitations in processing complex, noisy, or structurally inconsistent inputs, thereby motivating the transition toward more flexible, learning-based methodologies. By incorporating semantic reasoning, dynamic tool use, and memory-based planning, the integration of RAG and agentic frameworks promises enhanced generalization, interpretability, and task adaptability across diverse application domains.

\vspace{0.5cm}

Early advancements in natural language processing (NLP) employed conventional machine learning models primarily for pattern classification tasks. However, it was not until the emergence of large language models (LLMs) that semantic parsing at scale became practically feasible. Foundational studies by Locascio et al.~\cite{locascio2016neural} and Li et al.~\cite{li2020transregex} introduced neural methodologies for inferring regular expressions from natural language descriptions and examples, effectively bridging the gap between symbolic and subsymbolic approaches. These contributions established a foundational link between neural representation learning and symbolic rule induction, paving the way for architectures that integrate retrieval and reasoning mechanisms—such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)—and ultimately enabling the design of agent-based systems capable of context-sensitive pattern generation.

\vspace{0.5cm}

Building upon these developments, the study by Ferrag et al.~\cite{ferrag2025can} titled \textit{Can Retrieval-Augmented Language Models Reason?} investigates the role of retrieval mechanisms in facilitating multi-hop reasoning for complex tasks. The authors demonstrate that even high-performing closed-book models, such as GPT-4, experience notable performance gains when augmented with classical retrieval methods like BM25. This is particularly evident in scenarios that require reasoning over factual or multi-step content. The research introduces a suite of novel benchmarks designed to evaluate this interaction, revealing that the integration of retrieval-augmented LLMs with structured reasoning chains consistently outperforms either approach in isolation. These findings reinforce the conceptual shift toward viewing retrieval not merely as a knowledge enhancer, but as a fundamental catalyst for effective reasoning in language models.

\vspace{0.5cm}

Moreover, the study contributes a comprehensive taxonomy of over 60 benchmarks developed between 2019 and 2025, aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of large language models and autonomous agents across a diverse array of domains, including mathematical reasoning, domain-specific question answering, code generation, and multimodal problem-solving. These benchmarking frameworks extend beyond traditional language model assessment; they provide critical insights for the design and evaluation of agentic systems, particularly in contexts where tool orchestration, decision-making, and adaptive planning are central to task execution~\cite{ferrag2025can}.

\vspace{0.5cm}

Incorporating these insights, this thesis aligns with contemporary trajectories in large language model (LLM) research by proposing a system that unifies retrieval, reasoning, and autonomous agent planning. The resulting framework not only addresses the limitations of traditional Regular Expression (RegEx)-based approaches but also extends their applicability to complex, real-world data extraction tasks. By integrating semantic understanding, dynamic tool use, and contextual adaptation, the system represents a significant step toward more robust and intelligent information extraction pipelines.

\vspace{0.5cm}

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), introduced by Lewis et al.~\cite{lewis2020retrieval}, integrates pretrained transformer models with a retrieval module, enabling dynamic access to external documents at inference time. This architectural innovation markedly improves factual grounding and generalization capabilities across a range of natural language processing tasks. Expanding upon this foundation, Ferrag et al.~\cite{ferrag2025can} examine the potential of RAG to support multi-hop reasoning in complex problem domains. Their findings indicate that even state-of-the-art closed-book LLMs—such as GPT-4 and Gemini—exhibit significant performance enhancements when augmented with classical retrieval mechanisms like BM25. Through extensive benchmarking of retrieval-augmented and agentic configurations, the study reveals that the performance gains are particularly pronounced in tasks involving complex, multi-step reasoning.

\vspace{0.5cm}

The paper introduces a taxonomy of over 60 benchmarks spanning diverse domains such as academic reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, factual grounding, and multimodal task execution~\cite{ferrag2025can}. It further investigates agentic variants that integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with task-oriented planning, reflective reasoning loops, and modular tool utilization. These systems are designed not only to retrieve contextually relevant knowledge but also to engage in iterative reasoning, develop multi-step solution plans, and refine their behavior through self-corrective feedback mechanisms. This agentic approach demonstrates the potential for LLM-based systems to perform complex, goal-directed tasks with increasing levels of autonomy and robustness.

\vspace{0.5cm}

This study underscores that the synergy between retrieval and generation—when orchestrated through autonomous agent architectures—constitutes a robust pathway toward the development of highly capable, intelligent systems. It further highlights the necessity of designing benchmarks and evaluation frameworks that specifically assess real-world applicability, adaptability, and reasoning efficiency in such agentic configurations. These insights directly reinforce the core objective of this thesis: to move beyond static Regular Expression (RegEx)-based methods by introducing a dynamic, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Agentic AI pipeline capable of real-time semantic interpretation and information extraction.

\vspace{0.5cm}

As research in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) advanced, its limitations in addressing multi-hop and dynamic reasoning tasks became increasingly apparent. This led to the emergence of Agentic AI—a paradigm centered on autonomy, iterative planning, and sophisticated tool integration. Prominent agentic systems such as ReAct~\cite{react2022}, Reflexion~\cite{reflexion2023}, and AutoGPT~\cite{autogpt2023} exemplify cognitive characteristics including goal-directed behavior, reflective reasoning, and memory utilization. Recent contributions by Wu et al.~\cite{wu2025agents} and Ferrag et al.~\cite{ferrag2025can} introduced frameworks in which agents function as orchestrators, dynamically selecting among various tools—such as retrievers, executors, and evaluators—while refining outputs through self-reflective feedback. Ferrag et al.~\cite{ferrag2025can} further provide a comprehensive review of such systems, emphasizing that modern agentic architectures incorporate dynamic planning, memory-based state tracking, and modular toolkits for complex task decomposition.

\vspace{0.5cm}

The authors investigate how autonomous agents interact with external environments through modular interfaces, evaluating the reliability and adaptability of these interactions across a range of tasks, including text-based research, scientific inquiry, and software engineering. The study presents a suite of prominent AI-agent frameworks developed between 2023 and 2025—such as \textit{LitSearch}, \textit{ResearchArena}, and \textit{AgentTuning}—which integrate large language models (LLMs) with autonomous control modules. These systems are designed to manage complex research workflows, generate citations, and extract domain-specific information. A central finding is that such agentic frameworks demonstrate strong performance in dynamic environments where capabilities like tool selection, feedback integration, and error recovery are essential for task success~\cite{zeng2024agenttuning,kang2024researcharena}.

\vspace{0.5cm}

The study also identifies several critical challenges associated with the development and deployment of autonomous agents, including the need to ensure reproducibility, reduce hallucination rates, and establish robust ethical standards. Notably, it introduces a taxonomy comprising 60 benchmarks that span a wide array of domains, such as general knowledge reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, code synthesis, multimodal analysis, and embodied AI~\cite{ferrag2025can}. This taxonomy underscores the importance of evaluating agentic reasoning across diverse operational contexts. These findings directly inform the trajectory of this thesis and further support the case for agentic orchestration as a viable replacement for rigid, rule-based systems such as Regular Expressions (RegEx), offering instead dynamic, context-sensitive AI solutions.

\vspace{0.5cm}

In parallel, agentic architectures have been applied to a range of domain-specific challenges. In the context of time series analysis, Ravuru et al.~\cite{ravuru2024agent} demonstrated that autonomous agents, when integrated with domain-specific models, significantly outperformed traditional static approaches by dynamically composing and adapting analytical workflows. In the domain of academic research, systems such as \textit{LitSearch} and \textit{ResearchArena} have been developed to automate cognitively intensive tasks, including literature review, information synthesis, and hypothesis testing~\cite{kang2024researcharena}. These applications illustrate the potential of agentic reasoning to scale complex cognitive workflows while reducing reliance on direct human supervision. Furthermore, Ferrag et al.~\cite{ferrag2025can} highlight the utility of agentic frameworks in biomedical settings, where LLM-driven agents assist in diagnosis, patient communication, and clinical education by leveraging structured medical knowledge bases and formal clinical guidelines. Despite these advancements, significant challenges remain—particularly with respect to ethical oversight, interpretability, and domain-specific alignment of agent behavior.

\vspace{0.5cm}

The paper further highlights that large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly enhanced through methodologies such as \textit{Learn-by-Interact}, \textit{AgentGen}, and \textit{AgentTuning}~\cite{zeng2024agenttuning}, which enable agents to generate and refine data through real-time interaction or synthetic feedback loops. Reinforcement learning techniques are often incorporated into these pipelines, allowing for more efficient training via iterative refinement and human-in-the-loop feedback. As a result, these agents are not only proficient in technical domains—such as citation generation and symbolic reasoning—but also demonstrate competence in open-ended tasks, including policy simulation, collaborative writing, and software development. These advancements underscore the centrality of tool orchestration, modular design, and iterative learning as foundational principles for constructing scalable and adaptive agentic systems.

\vspace{0.5cm}

Moreover, multi-agent environments—where domain-specialized agents collaboratively address complex tasks—have emerged as a promising strategy for scaling artificial intelligence. Drawing inspiration from human teamwork, these architectures emulate collaborative planning, role assignment, and inter-agent communication protocols. As noted by Ferrag et al.~\cite{ferrag2025can}, large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems substantially enhance the capabilities of individual agents by enabling the division of cognitive labor and supporting collective reasoning. These agents engage in coordinated planning, structured dialogue, and consensus-building activities, effectively mirroring the cooperative dynamics of human teams and offering a scalable model for tackling interdependent subtasks in dynamic environments.


\vspace{0.5cm}

Multi-agent systems have been successfully applied across a variety of domains. In software development, individual agents specialize in coding, testing, and documentation, thereby facilitating modular and efficient workflows. In multi-robot control, these systems enable coordinated and distributed task execution, which is essential for managing complex operations. Additionally, agent-based models are utilized in social and policy simulations to capture intricate societal interactions, enabling the analysis of negotiation processes, strategic decision-making, and collective behavior. These applications not only demonstrate the technical feasibility of agent collaboration but also underscore their potential in addressing problems that require negotiation, strategic planning, and shared memory management~\cite{weiss2013multiagent, wooldridge2009introduction, stone2000multiagent}.



\vspace{0.5cm}

Recent frameworks have incorporated advanced training protocols that enable agents to acquire cooperative behaviors and adapt to dynamic environments. Techniques such as reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning~\cite{lowe2017multi}, trajectory optimization~\cite{todorov2012optimal}, and meta-learning~\cite{finn2017model} have been employed to enhance multi-agent coordination and flexibility. Through these mechanisms, multi-agent systems increasingly demonstrate the capacity to address open-ended, ambiguous, and interdependent tasks across a wide range of real-world applications.

\vspace{0.5cm}

Despite the promise of Agentic AI, several challenges remain. Most notably, the reproducibility of agent behaviors, high computational costs, and the necessity for fine-grained evaluation metrics continue to be underexplored. Ferrag et al.~\cite{ferrag2025can} emphasize the lack of standardized tools to systematically track agent decision-making processes, interactions with external systems, and mechanisms for failure recovery. Furthermore, although reinforcement learning and memory-augmented frameworks have contributed to performance improvements, many agentic systems remain vulnerable to adversarial inputs and exhibit brittleness when confronted with novel or out-of-distribution domains.

\vspace{0.5cm}

Another pressing challenge pertains to the integration of ethical governance, interpretability, and fairness within agent decision-making processes. The absence of transparent models and explainable reasoning mechanisms undermines trust in automated system outputs, particularly in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and legal analysis~\cite{doshi-velez2017towards, barocas2019fairness, rudin2019stop}. Additionally, real-time performance continues to present a significant bottleneck, as many agentic systems experience considerable latency stemming from complex planning and retrieval operations~\cite{sutton2018reinforcement, huang2021efficient}.

\vspace{0.5cm}

To address these challenges, ongoing efforts focus on developing modular benchmarks that evaluate distinct agentic capabilities, including real-time planning, collaborative tool use, and long-term memory retention. Proposed taxonomies categorize evaluations into areas such as factual reasoning, symbolic manipulation, multimodal inference, and embodied task execution~\cite{perez2021modular, muller2023taxonomy, lewis2020retrieval, dosovitskiy2020standardized, bosselut2021comet}. These initiatives aim to establish standardized agent benchmarking frameworks, enabling researchers to systematically track progress and diagnose limitations in a reproducible manner.

\vspace{0.5cm}

Collectively, the literature reflects a clear trajectory: from rigid, rule-based systems toward adaptable, intelligent agents capable of interpreting context, planning actions, and autonomously executing tasks~\cite{lewis2020retrieval, ferrag2025can, muller2023taxonomy}. This thesis builds upon this trajectory by focusing on the novel integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Agentic AI to supplant traditional Regular Expressions (RegEx) in real-world pattern extraction scenarios.
